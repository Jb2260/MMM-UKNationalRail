To use this module, add it to the modules array in the `config/config.js` file:

```javascript
modules: [
    {
		module: 'MMM-UKNationalRail',
		position: 'bottom_left',
		config: {
			stationCode: 		'SUR', 		// CRS code for station
			app_id: 			'03bf8009', 	// TransportAPI App ID
			app_key: 			'd9307fd91b0247c607e098d5effedc97', // TransportAPI App Key
			maxResults: 		5,  //Optional - Maximum results to display.
			showOrigin: 		false   //Optional - Show the origin of the train in the table
		}
	},
]
```
There are 3 MANDATORY fields - `stationCode`, `app_id` and `app_key`. All the others are used to limit the amount of info you get back, especially useful for busy stations like Clapham Junction.
